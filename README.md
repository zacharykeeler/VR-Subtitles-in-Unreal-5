# SP23-Subtitles-In-A-Virtual-Environment

This project explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of various subtitle presentation methods in Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Our goal is to improve the accessibility and user experience of VR content through effective and intuitive subtitle methods.

## Overview

A detailed PDF report of our results is available [here](Subtitles_in_a_Virtual_Environment_Final_Report.pdf).

This method of subtitles adds a plane behind the subtitles and a portrait image of the speaking character.

### Method 3: Head Mounted Display Subtitles

This style of subtitle is fixed to the Head Mounted Display. The subtitles are always visible as the viewer looks in any direction.
